# team-profile-generator 

## Description

A tool for managers that displays their team's basic info so that they have quick access to their emails and Github repos. The manager is first prompted for their name, id, email, and office number, and then are asked if they would like to add more employees. Engineers can be added using their name, id, email, and Github username, while interns can be added using their name, id, email, and school. Upon completion, a functional HTML page with the inputted info is generated. Clicking an email address initializes an email to the employee in the user's email application, and clicking an engineer's Github username opens their profile page in a new tab.
